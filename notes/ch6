SIGNED NUMBER ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS
    to avoid errors in signend number operations
    note addition and subtraction is always correct regardless of signed or unsiged numbers
    use
        CBW : convert signed byte to signed word
            the oprand is assumed to be AL and the contents of AH will be distroyed
            D7 of AL will be copied into AH. ADDING THE SIGN BIT TO THE RIGHT DOES NOT CHANGE THE VALUE OF THE NUMBER
        CWD : convert signed word to double word
            the oprand is assuemd to be in AX and the contents of DX will be the same as the signed bit of AX
        IDIV: signed number division
            see tables for rules
        IMUL: signed number multiplication
            see tables 
        Arithmetic shift:
        SAL IS THE SAME AS SHL
        BUT SAR copies the signed flag "MSB" AS IT SHIFTS AND THE LSB IN CARRAY FLAG AS NORMAL
        
        Signed number comparsion
        CMP dest, source
        it is the same as for unsigned number but the jump codition after using CMP is not the same as unsigned numbers
