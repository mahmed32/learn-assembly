MACROS AND THE MOUSE

WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF USING MACROS?

- Imagin you are writing a chat system and you frequently asking for string input
  and displying string output back. the normal way to do this is each time a you
  need an input you invoke int21h with the approprite parameters for it.
  but imagine you are doing it 100 times this is a lot of typing and will introduse
  alot of error. another solution is to copy/paste. try it and you will know that 
  this solution is the worst forever. Here Macros comes in a macro is just a block
  of code that is represted by name and an optional parameters for the macro.
  so for our problem a macro can be used just as this
  READSTRING BUFFER
  the block of code is exactly the same as the normal way you do it but the advantage
  here is you write it and test it once and you can use that line of code at any time
  you want a string from the user.

HOW TO DEFINE A MACRO

- A macro contains of 3 parts

  name MACRO para1, para2,....paraN
       .....
       ;code 
       ....
       ENDM
       
HOW TO INVOKE A MACRO

- the defintion must be befor the invocation
  
  <macroname>   para1, para2....paraN


HOW THE MACROS ARE EXPANDED

- use .lst file to know

LOCAL DIRECTIVE?

- If there is a label inside your macro then if you call it more than one time
  the assembler will give you an error because it will not allow multiple lable 
  with the same name.
  if you want a label inside you macro use LABEL DIRECTIVE as follows

  <macro name> MACRO    para1, para2,...paraN
               LOCAL <label name1>, <label name2>.....
               ....
               ;code
               ....
               ENDM
  note that the LOCAL must come immidiatly after the MACRO.

INCLUDE DIRECTIVE?

- to use MACROS in more than one file one can store them in a separte file 
  and then copy and paste them in each new file that he will use the macros in
  BUT with INCLUDE directive one can store that file with .mac extention and
  then just write the following at the top of the file

  INCLUDE <file name>.MAC

INT 33H??? MOUSE???
