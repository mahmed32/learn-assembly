HOW THE LABEL DIRECTIVE IS USED?
WHAT IS AN INTERRUPT?

- INT xx  ;interrupt range from 00h to FFh
- an INT is just like a FAR CALL but it saves also the flag register.

BOIS INT 10H PROGRAMMING used for screen IO
- monitor screen mode (graphics and text modes)
  - text mode
    the pixels are cobioned into groups 8 by 8 pixel per letter
    the screen has 80 column and 25 rows number from (0, 0) at the
    top left corner and (0, 79) at the top right corner and from
    (24, 0) at the bottom left corner and (24, 79) at the bottom right corner
  
  - Clearing the screen INT 10H with functino 06H
    INT 10H is used
    AH = 06H is a scroll up function
    AL = 0 for clear otherwise will be number of lines to scroll
    BH = is back ground color see bios color attributes(16 colors)
    CX = 0000 CH upper row number , CL left column number
    DX = 184Fh DH lower row number, DL right column number

  - Setting the curser to a specific postion
    INT 10h is used
    AH = 02h set curser function
    BH = page number
    DH row number
    DL column number

  - Get the cursor position
    INT 10h is used
    AH = 03h function number
    BH = 00 page number
    the row will be in DH and the column in DL

  - read to know about pixel programming.

DOS INTERRUPT 21H  string input output
 - option 09 output buffer to the screen
   the effective address of the buffer must be in DX
   the int function will begin printing from the buffer up until it counters a '$'
 - option 02h will output a single character even '$'
   the character must be in DL
 
 - option 01 will input a single character with echo
   the int will wait untill the character input then will print it back to the schreen
   and put it in AL
 - option 0A will input a string of data from the keyboard
   the buffer must be as follows 
   BUFFER LABEL BYTE
   BUFFSZE      DB      <number of max characters that the user allowed to input>
   BUFCUNT      DB      <number of actual data entered by the user>
   BUFDATA      DB      < n DUP('$') >

   the interrupt function will continue accept input from the user unitll he hits CR key 0Dh in hex
   then if the number of inputted characters are greater than the maximum allowed size the CR will
   be the last character in bufdata and the bufcount will be bufsize-1.

   the CR is used to move to the begining to the current line
   the line feed is used to move to the next line with same x coordinate
   CR is 0Dh and LF is 0Ah
   
   option 07 will input without echo
   will accept single character withou echo back to the screen.
   the character will be in AL.
